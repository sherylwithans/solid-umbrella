Investors are assessing earnings reports from some of the biggest U.S. companies this week to see if the strong run-up in market since the start of the year is justified as the main Wall Street indexes hover below all-time highs.
The S&P 500 is trading roughly 0.5% below its intraday record hit in late September, while the Nasdaq hit an intra-day record high on Wednesday but failed to close at those levels.
"As the earnings season gains potency, the missing link to a stronger upward move is low volume, suggesting a cautious attitude by investors," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.
