Check out the companies making headlines after the bell:

Shares of Facebook popped more than 7% in extended trading Wednesday following the release of the social media giant's first-quarter earnings. Facebook reported earnings per share of 85 cents, which was not comparable to analysts' estimates due to a $3 billion legal expense related to a Federal Trade Commission inquiry into Facebook's privacy policies.
Revenue came in at $15.08 billion, topping Wall Street's $14.98 billion forecast, according to Refinitiv. Daily active users increased 8% year over year to total 1.56 billion. Average revenue per user was $6.42, beating estimates of $6.39.

Microsoft shares jumped more than 3% after hours Wednesday after the company posted better-than-expected third-quarter earnings. The second largest company by market valuation, behind Apple, earned $30.57 billion in revenue during the period. That tops estimates of $29.84 billion, according to analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.
