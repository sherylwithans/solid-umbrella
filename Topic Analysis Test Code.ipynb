While the tech-heavy Nasdaq had help from eBay Inc\\'s upbeat earnings and a chipmaker rally, investors were digesting a mixed bag of reports. The S&P 500, closing roughly 0.5% below its intraday record high hit in late September, has rallied about 17% year-to-date. It has been supported by a dovish Federal Reserve, hopes of a U.S.-China trade deal and largely upbeat earnings. But with big companies such as Microsoft Corp, Facebook Inc, reporting after the close on Wednesday and Amazon.com and Intel Corp reports on tap for Thursday afternoon many investors kept to the sidelines.\\n\"While the expectations are for good reports from all four of them recent strength and relative valuations are keeping people on the edge of their seat,\" Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.\\n\"There was no needle moving news today for people to be making bigger bets on anything after the big move we had yesterday.\"\\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 59.34 points, or 0.22%, to 26,597.05, the S&P 500 lost 6.43 points, or 0.22%, to 2,927.25 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 18.81 points, or 0.23%, to 8,102.02.\\nProfits of S&P 500 companies are expected to decline 1.1% for the first quarter, still a large improvement from the 2.3% drop estimated at the start of April. And nearly 78% of the 129 companies that have reported so far have surpassed earnings estimates, according to Refinitiv data.\\n\"The overall picture confirms the economy is on a steady footing.

Facebook set aside $3 billion to cover anticipated costs associated with the settlement, but said the charges could reach as high as $5 billion.\\nIf the settlement is in that range, it would be the largest civil penalty paid to the agency, said David Vladeck, a former FTC official now at Georgetown Law School.\\n\"Everyone expected there would be a substantial civil penalty in this case,\" said Vladeck. \"There\\'s no question that Facebook is going to have to settle this matter. Investors want this behind them.\"\\nThe accrual cut the company\\'s net income in the first quarter to $2.43 billion, or $0.85 per share.\\nExcluding the $3 billion it set aside, Facebook would have earned $1.89 a share, up from $1.69 the year prior and easily beating analysts\\' average estimate of $1.63 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\\nTotal first-quarter revenue rose 26 percent to $14.9 billion from $12.0 billion last year, compared to analysts\\' average estimate of $15.0 billion.\\nShares of Facebook rose 10 percent to $200.50 in after-hours trade, demonstrating the company\\'s resilience despite a series of scandals over improperly shared user data and propaganda that made it the target of political scrutiny across the globe.\\nThe company\\'s shares lost a third of their value last year, after executives first warned about costs associated with its drive to improve safety and slowing growth in revenue and operating margin.\\nTotal expenses in the first quarter were $11.8 billion, up 80 percent compared with a year ago. The operating margin fell to 22 percent from 46 percent a year ago, but would have been 42 percent without the one-time expense.\\n\"This is a strong report suggesting that advertisers still see value in Facebook\\'s platform, as they did before the controversies and scandals erupted,\" said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at financial markets platform Investing.com.\\nExecutives have forecast that expenses will grow 40 to 50 percent in 2019, but say they expect the downward trend to taper off after this year as revenue from new ways of pushing ads and facilitating transactions offset the security spending.\\nMonthly and daily users of the main Facebook app compared to last quarter were both up 8 percent to 2.38 billion and 1.56 billion, respectively.\\nEstimates were for 2.4 billion monthly users and 1.6 billion daily users, according to Refinitiv averages.

The number marks the second consecutive quarter of growth in the continent, after declines in the first half of 2018.\\n\\n\"Despite the negative media coverage and the new privacy regulations brought into Europe, Facebook continues to show stable user trends with growth in Europe this quarter on a sequential basis,\" said Christopher Rossbach, CIO of private investment firm J. Stern & Co., in an email Thursday.\\n\\nThe social media giant was quick to blame last year\\'s slowdown on Europe\\'s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, a massive privacy law that went into effect in May. The law aims to give consumers more control over their personal data, for example by requiring users to reaffirm a company\\'s privacy policy before using its platform. Facebook warned this would impact user growth.\\n\"[In] Europe, we saw the declines that we anticipated from GDPR,\" Facebook CFO David Wehner said on the company\\'s July 2018 earnings call. \"And I would say there, really, those impacts were purely due to the GDPR impact, not other engagement trends.\"\\nNow, there are signs those concerns were overblown. In a note published Thursday morning, analysts at Baird said Facebook\\'s 4 million new daily active users in Europe are \"a potential sign that the engagement impact of GDPR was transitory.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEurope\\'s rebound could bolster the case for more regulation, not least from Facebook itself. On Wednesday\\'s earnings call, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg reiterated his call for more privacy regulation like GDPR. Users, meanwhile, have consistently forgiven the company for seemingly endless privacy and security lapses over the past year.\\n\"Everyone talks about this distrust that they have of Facebook now but at the end of the day they\\'re simply hooked on this platform,\" said Gene Munster, managing partner at Loup Ventures, on CNBC\\'s Fast Money Wednesday.\\nWhere GDPR does appear to have a bigger impact is on Facebook\\'s advertising targeting strategy.\\n\"The number of people who have opted out on using context from the apps and websites that they visit for ad targeting has continued to increase since the adoption of GDPR, so we\\'ve seen that come up both in Europe and around the world,\" Wehner said on Wednesday\\'s earnings call.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nshow chapters\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t    \\t                 \\n            Loup Ventures Gene Munster breaks down Facebook earnings020202\\n\\t\\t\\t                         5:33  PM ET Wed, 24 April 2019 |  02:42 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.mpsinit=mps._queue.mpsinit||[]; \\n    mps._queue.mpsinit.push(function() { \\n      mps.insertComponent(\\'#taboola_article_you_may_like\\', \\'taboola-article-you-may-like\\') \\n    });\\n'],\n",

The strong result \"speaks to the strength of its engagement, ad offering and ability to drive earnings power ... even while aggressively investing to improve its platform.\"\\nDigging into the numbers, Facebook sales, monthly active users and average revenue per user all topped estimates in the quarter. That was enough to draw an upgrade from UBS analyst Eric Sheridan, who changed his rating on Facebook shares to buy from neutral.\\n\"We continue to see FB as a core large cap Internet holding for strong revenue growth at reasonable valuation multiples against 2-3 year growth,\" he wrote. \"Based on our analysis, medium-term growth opportunities (Instagram, Video & Messenger) are under-appreciated relative to peers.\"\\nFacebook\\'s profit, revenue and user numbers hit record highs during the quarter. Facebook shares closed at $182.58 on Wednesday.\\nHere\\'s a wrap of all the major analyst opinions.\\n\\n\\n\\nUBS (buy; $240 target)\\n\\n\"While 2019 remains a year of transition, FB mgmt has now produced multiple quarters with ahead of consensus revenue/EPS performance (we believe driven by user/engagement/revenue growth on Instagram). Instagram is now one of the Internet\\'s large scaled digital ad platforms that can sustain growth & operating leverage (even as the platform transitions to Stories/Shopping) for years to come. While concerns will persist about core Facebook maturation, regulatory headwinds and/or safeguarding the platform for a privacy first approach, we think the market now better understands many of those risks (as they dominate almost all of our investor conversations).\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCiti (buy; $212 target)\\n\\n\"FB reported strong 1Q19 results, with revenue slightly ahead of even the most bullish expectations and expense growth slowing more than most expected ... All in, we see a combination of solid topline growth and improving expense trends to result in a 20% 3-yr revenue CAGR, stabilizing margins in 2020, and >$8 in GAAP EPS in 2020. With the equity currently valued at 24x our 20E GAAP EPS and with strong/improving fundamentals, we maintain our Buy rating.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nMorgan Stanley (buy; $210 target)\\n\\n\"What a start to 2019: FB\\'s strong start to 2019 C across the board 1Q revenue, free cash flow, EPS and active user beats C speaks to the strength of its engagement, ad offering and ability to drive earnings power...even while aggressively investing to improve its platform safety/security, product offerings, and monetization. We were particularly impressed by the 32% free cash flow beat as strong top-line and more capex/opex discipline drove upside. Advertising upside was driven by broad strength across Instagram News Feed, Stories and core Facebook News Feed (where pricing continues to rise).\"\\n\\n\\n\\nJ.P. Morgan (overweight; $245 target)\\n\\n\"We believe 1Q represents another qtr in which FB showed its ability to maintain strong engagement & also effectively manage revenue deceleration, which should give the Street increased confidence going forward. We continue to believe that FB can deliver 20\\'s% revenue growth in 2020 w/moderating expense growth, driving strong re-acceleration in earnings growth next yearwe model ~17% growth ex-accrual.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nGoldman Sachs (buy; $228 target)\\n\\n\"Buy-rated Facebook reported 1Q19 revenue above expectations. Total ad revenue of $14.91bn came in above the Street, with FactSet consensus of $14.78bn. While management accrued $3bn in the quarter for an FTC settlement, if we exclude this one-time item, GAAP operating margins would have been 42% (vs. 22% reported) which easily surpassed the Street forecast of 35.9%. GAAP EPS including the accrual was $0.85, however if we exclude this non-tax deductible accrual GAAP EPS would have been $1.89 which compares to consensus of $1.62. Below the line items were a $0.03 headwind to EPS in the quarter.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBank of America Merrill Lynch (buy; $187 target)\\n\\n\"Results were quite strong, though call commentary that privacy would impact revenue growth in 2H\\'19 and that Facebook remains committed to investing in 2019 \"and 2020\" may take away some of the trading momentum on potential for positive estimate revisions. Still with Facebook again beating its 1Q revenue outlook and lowering its expense guide, Street may see commentary as conservative. With revenue growth rates exceeding expectations (only a modest 2 points of q/q deceleration from shift to stories) we reiterate our Buy and remain optimistic on stories, messaging and video monetization, while expense growth is likely near a y/y peak.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBarclays (overweight; $240 target)\\n\\n\"Facebook reported revenue ~1% and OI (ex-fine) 18% above consensus in 1Q. Shares remain under-owned among the long-only community based on our conversations, so we may start to see a \"performance chasing\" dynamic as shares continue to ascend. The tone of the call was upbeat and Zuckerberg did a very good job explaining his longer-term vision which should put to rest some of the confusion following the early March manifesto. Stepping back, at 20x 2020 EPS, given the light LO positioning, we still see FB as one of the more compelling ideas in mega cap internet.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nDeutsche Bank (buy; $220 target)\\n\\n\"We feel better about Facebook\\'s medium term top line trajectory given lower-than-feared deceleration in 1Q (2.2ppts), skepticism around management\\'s guidance for greater 2H sequential growth deceleration, increased advertisers in Stories (3M vs 2M last quarter), and reduced customer concentration. Opex and capex growth already look to be moderating and the reduced guidance still looks conservative to us as it implies re-accelerating opex despite easier comps.

Total ad revenue of $14.91bn came in above the Street, with FactSet consensus of $14.78bn. While management accrued $3bn in the quarter for an FTC settlement, if we exclude this one-time item, GAAP operating margins would have been 42% (vs. 22% reported) which easily surpassed the Street forecast of 35.9%. GAAP EPS including the accrual was $0.85, however if we exclude this non-tax deductible accrual GAAP EPS would have been $1.89 which compares to consensus of $1.62.

Still with Facebook again beating its 1Q revenue outlook and lowering its expense guide, Street may see commentary as conservative. With revenue growth rates exceeding expectations (only a modest 2 points of q/q deceleration from shift to stories) we reiterate our Buy and remain optimistic on stories, messaging and video monetization, while expense growth is likely near a y/y peak.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBarclays (overweight; $240 target)\\n\\n\"Facebook reported revenue ~1% and OI (ex-fine) 18% above consensus in 1Q.

The tone of the call was upbeat and Zuckerberg did a very good job explaining his longer-term vision which should put to rest some of the confusion following the early March manifesto. Stepping back, at 20x 2020 EPS, given the light LO positioning, we still see FB as one of the more compelling ideas in mega cap internet.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nDeutsche Bank (buy; $220 target)\\n\\n\"We feel better about Facebook\\'s medium term top line trajectory given lower-than-feared deceleration in 1Q (2.2ppts), skepticism around management\\'s guidance for greater 2H sequential growth deceleration, increased advertisers in Stories (3M vs 2M last quarter), and reduced customer concentration. Opex and capex growth already look to be moderating and the reduced guidance still looks conservative to us as it implies re-accelerating opex despite easier comps.

GAAP EPS including the accrual was $0.85, however if we exclude this non-tax deductible accrual GAAP EPS would have been $1.89 which compares to consensus of $1.62.

As of Tuesday, just 129 companies, or 26% of the S&P had reported.\\n\\nAs of April 1, the expected decline was 2% from last year.\\nWhile it\\'s still early, some analysts say earnings revisions went too far, and the quarter should turn out to have positive growth.\\n\"It would appear, given both the early trend in 1Q\\'19 reporting and the notable increase in outlook for profit growth over the next twelve months, that forecasts of an \\'earnings recession\\' were premature,\" wrote Strategas Research\\'s Nicholas Bohnsack.\\nJ.P. Morgan strategists said the outlook for earnings was too pessimistic, and they expected the decline in first-quarter profits to turn around by the end of the reporting period, with S&P 500 companies delivering a 4% to 5% earnings surprise and profit growth of 2% to 3%.\\nThere have been high-profile winners and losers. On Thursday morning, 3M missed on the top and bottom lines and had a disappointing forecast. Facebook and Microsoft, on the other hand, beat their forecasts Wednesday afternoon. Facebook shares were up more than 5% Thursday while 3M was down 12%.\\nOn average, Refinitiv data shows earnings have come in 5.9% above estimates, a higher-than-typical earnings surprise factor, which has been 5.4% over the past four quarters. So far, 78% of companies have reported better than expected earnings results, well above the long-term average of 65%.\\nRevenue growth has averaged 4.1%, but the blended version, which includes those that have not yet reported, would be a 5% increase if companies meet forecasts.

Analysts polled by Refinitiv expected a profit of $2.49 per share on sales of $8.025 billion. The company also cut its guidance for 2019 and announced layoffs for 2,000 workers.\\n\\nAmerican Express  American Express shares rose 1.6% after an analyst at Morgan Stanley upgraded it to overweight from equal-weight. The analyst cited strong revenue growth moving forward for the upgrade.\\nUnited Parcel Service  Shares of the shipping giant dropped 8.1% after missing its earnings and revenue missed Wall Street forecasts. Snowstorms and heavy flooding in the Midwest disrupted operations last quarter, and UPS said it incurred roughly $80 million in extra costs to deal with those severe weather conditions.\\nSouthwest Airlines  The airline's shares rose 0.8% after the company's quarterly results beat analyst expectations despite taking a hit from the prolonged grounding of Boeing's 737 Max jets. The grounding, coupled with the impacts of the U.S. government shutdown, forced Southwest to cancel more than 10,000 flights last quarter.\\nComcast  Comcast shares climbed 2.6% after reporting first-quarter earnings that surpassed expectations. The media company reported adjusted earnings per share of 76 cents versus 68 cents expected in a Refinitiv survey. CNBC also reported, citing sources, that Comcast is in talks with Disney to sell its 30% stake in Hulu.\\nTesla  Tesla shares fell 4.3% after posting disappointing first-quarter results. The automotive company reported a loss of $2.90 on revenue of $4.54 billion. Refinitiv estimates expected a loss of 69 cents on revenue of $5.19 billion. The company noted weakening demand for electric vehicles.\\nMicrosoft  The tech giant's stock climbed 3.3% on the back of stronger-than-forecast quarterly numbers. Microsoft reported earnings per share of $1.14 on revenue of $30.6 billion. Analysts polled by Refinitiv expected a profit of $1 per share on sales of $29.84 billion.

That\\'s a big slowdown from 97% year-over-year growth last quarter, and over 100% growth for three consecutive quarters before that.\\nHowever, the rate of growth was artificially boosted in 2018 by an accounting change in January 2018. On an adjusted basis, the year-over-year growth rate in the \"Other\" segment in Q4 2018 was only 38%, and ranged between 51% and 73% in the previous quarters last year. So, while advertising growth has slowed, the drop-off was not as dramatic as it seemed to be from the company\\'s earnings statement.\\n\\nAmazon\\'s fast-growing advertising business has been a bright spot for the company amid slowing growth in its core e-commerce business.\\nAccording to figures from eMarketer, Amazon has become the number three digital advertiser in the U.S, behind only Alphabet\\'s Google and Facebook. CNBC previously reported that some consumer packaged goods advertisers were moving as much as half of their search ad budget from Google to Amazon, where an advertisement can be converted into an immediate sale on the site.\\nAs of February, Amazon was expected to take over 8.8% of net digital ad revenue share in the U.S. It still trails behind Google, which is expected to have 37.2% share this year, and Facebook, with an expected 22.1%, according to eMarketer.\\nAnalysts during the earnings call asked executives to comment on any supply and demand dynamics at play with the advertising business because of an apparent step down in the advertising business. Amazon\\'s chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky declined to elaborate on ad loads or inventory, but said the company is working to drive relevancy and serving useful ads.\\n\"Most of our focus has been on adding more functionality, adding more products and adding reporting for businesses and advertisers so they can understand the incremental customers we\\'re seeing through advertising with Amazon,\" he said. He added the company has been making operational improvements like adding tools, making better recommendations, making it easier to use Amazon demand-side platforms. \"We\\'re very focused on serving brands as well.\"\\nAnother asked if these improvements could re-accelerate growth, or if Amazon\\'s ads business is now facing the \"law of large numbers.\"\\n\"I wouldn\\'t comment on acceleration or deceleration of growth, I would just say we\\'re early on in this venture, it\\'s having a lot of pickup by both both vendors, sellers and also authors we feel like If we work on the inputs in this business and continue to grow traffic to the site, we will have a good outcome in the advertising space,\" Olsavsky said.\\nAmazon\\'s steady expansion beyond e-commerce has drawn fire from some politicians.\\nMost prominently, Democratic candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren in March unveiled a plan to break up Amazon and other tech giants, saying they have \"too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy.\" In particular, Warren has said Amazon plays a dual role of running a marketplace and selling its own products in it, creating a \"conflict of interest.\" Amazon removed some promotional spots for its own products earlier this year, possibly in response.\\nThe company revealed the numbers as it reported better-than-expected earnings Thursday. The stock barely moved after hours, as revenue was mostly in line with expectations and operating profit guidance for the second quarter was light.\\nUpdate: This story and its headline have been changed to reflect the fact that Amazon\\'s advertising growth rates were partly affected by an accounting change in Q1 2018. On an adjusted basis, growth rates did not drop as dramatically in Q1 2019 as originally stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nshow chapters\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t    \\t                 \\n            Amazon realizing the challenges of physical stores, says former Toys R Us CEO020202\\n\\t\\t\\t                        1 Hour Ago |  04:19 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.mpsinit=mps._queue.mpsinit||[]; \\n    mps._queue.mpsinit.push(function() { \\n      mps.insertComponent(\\'#taboola_article_you_may_like\\', \\'taboola-article-you-may-like\\') \\n    });\\n'],\n",

The probe has focused on whether the sharing of data and other disputes violated a 2011 agreement with the FTC to safeguard user privacy.\\nThe settlement accrual, which Facebook set at $3 billion but said could rise as high as $5 billion, cut the company\\'s net income in the first quarter to $2.43 billion, or 85 cents per share.\\nSeveral Democrats in Congress on Wednesday said a $5 billion fine would amount to a \"slap on the wrist\" for Facebook.

       "  'One of Amazon\\'s most promising new business areas, advertising sales, appears to be slowing down.\\n\\nThe growth of Amazon\\'s \"Other\" segment, which consists primarily of advertising sales, slowed dramatically to 36% in the first quarter from the previous year, at $2.72 billion. That\\'s a big slowdown from 97% year-over-year growth last quarter, and over 100% growth for three consecutive quarters before that.\\nHowever, the rate of growth was artificially boosted in 2018 by an accounting change in January 2018. On an adjusted basis, the year-over-year growth rate in the \"Other\" segment in Q4 2018 was only 38%, and ranged between 51% and 73% in the previous quarters last year. So, while advertising growth has slowed, the drop-off was not as dramatic as it seemed to be from the company\\'s earnings statement.\\n\\nAmazon\\'s fast-growing advertising business has been a bright spot for the company amid slowing growth in its core e-commerce business.\\nAccording to figures from eMarketer, Amazon has become the number three digital advertiser in the U.S, behind only Alphabet\\'s Google and Facebook. CNBC previously reported that some consumer packaged goods advertisers were moving as much as half of their search ad budget from Google to Amazon, where an advertisement can be converted into an immediate sale on the site.\\nAs of February, Amazon was expected to take over 8.8% of net digital ad revenue share in the U.S. It still trails behind Google, which is expected to have 37.2% share this year, and Facebook, with an expected 22.1%, according to eMarketer.\\nAmazon\\'s steady expansion beyond e-commerce has drawn fire from some politicians.\\nMost prominently, Democratic candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren in March unveiled a plan to break up Amazon and other tech giants, saying they have \"too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy.\" In particular, Warren has said Amazon plays a dual role of running a marketplace and selling its own products in it, creating a \"conflict of interest.\" Amazon removed some promotional spots for its own products earlier this year, possibly in response.\\nThe company revealed the numbers as it reported better-than-expected earnings Thursday. The stock barely moved after hours, as revenue was mostly in line with expectations and operating profit guidance for the second quarter was light.\\nUpdate: This story and its headline have been changed to reflect the fact that Amazon\\'s advertising growth rates were partly affected by an accounting change in Q1 2018. On an adjusted basis, growth rates did not drop as dramatically in Q1 2019 as originally stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nshow chapters\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t    \\t                 \\n            Amazon realizing the challenges of physical stores, says former Toys R Us CEO020202\\n\\t\\t\\t                        38 Mins Ago |  04:19 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.mpsinit=mps._queue.mpsinit||[]; \\n    mps._queue.mpsinit.push(function() { \\n      mps.insertComponent(\\'#taboola_article_you_may_like\\', \\'taboola-article-you-may-like\\') \\n    });\\n'],\n",

By then, they are already dead\".Revenue for the company, also the world's second-biggest maker of smartphones, touched 721 billion yuan ($105 billion) last year, eight times ZTE's and half the annual sales of South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co.But its business has come under pressure over the past year given mounting international scrutiny, led by U.S. allegations that its equipment could be used by Beijing for spying, a concern the company has said is unfounded.STOCKPILINGA range of Asian and European suppliers would also be hurt if Huawei was forced to curb production, while telecom carriers that rely on Huawei, and have largely resisted U.S. calls to bar the company, would be left scrambling just as countries race to roll out next-generation 5G mobile networks. \"Huawei being unable to manufacture network servers, for example, because they can't get key U.S. components would mean they also stop buying parts from other countries altogether,\" said an executive at a Huawei chip supplier. \"They can relatively better manage component sourcing for mobile phones because they have their own component businesses for smartphones. But server and network, it's a different story,\" the executive said.According to brokerage Jefferies, the sanctions would mean a \"nightmare for China's 5G\" too. The country, which is targeting a nationwide rollout next year, will very likely slow down its 5G push as a result, it added.However, industry participants pointed out that Huawei had been stockpiling components such as chips to ease disruptions.Its initial target was to build inventories of six to nine months, and it has recently been raised to 12 and, in some cases, 24 months, Jefferies said.Shares in Huawei suppliers fell across in Asia on the news of the U.S. blacklist.South Korea's Samsung dropped 2.4%, SK Hynix fell 3.5%, while China's Luxshare Precision Industry fell as much as 6.1%. Shares in ZTE also tumbled.Huawei has said it is \"ready and willing to engage with the U.S. government and come up with effective measures to ensure product security\".Its rotating Chairman Eric Xu also told Reuters in a recent interview that \"in case of unforeseen events ... we definitely have our contingency plan. What we have prepared has already been used in some of our products in the Chinese market\".Huawei has spearheaded China's campaign to develop its own high-end technologies to reduce reliance on imports and such efforts have taken on urgency after U.S. sanctions on ZTE.The ZTE case led to some \"benefits\" and \"external pressures have developed into internal drivers\" in China, said Wan Gang, vice chairman of China's parliamentary advisory body.TRADE TALKSThe pain for Huawei's supply chain would be redoubled if the trade war put a damper on the Chinese technology industry. \"The bigger concern would be U.S. allies that used to buy Huawei's components may not continue businesses with Huawei, because of fear of possibly upsetting the United States,\" said Doh Hyun-woo, an analyst at NH Investment & Securities in Seoul.The Trump administration's rhetoric toward China had cooled in recent days after another round of tariffs between the world's top two economies and a selloff on global stock markets.Tensions escalated on Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order barring American companies from using telecommunications equipment made by firms deemed to pose a national security risk.While the president's order did not specifically name any country or company, U.S. officials have previously labelled Huawei a \"threat\". \"The U.S. seems to have already decided to nail Huawei down,\" said the China-based U.S. tech company source. \"The problem is that because there doesn't seem to be a prospect for a trade deal in the near future, the U.S. has expedited the process of killing Huawei.\" ($1 = 6.8776 Chinese yuan)(Reporting by Sijia Jiang in Hong Kong, Josh Horwitz in Shanghai, Ju-min Park and Heekyong Yang in Seoul, Michael Martina and Cate Cadell in Beijing, Makiko Yamazaki in Tokyo; Writing Miyoung Kim; Editing by Himani Sarkar)\"\"\""
