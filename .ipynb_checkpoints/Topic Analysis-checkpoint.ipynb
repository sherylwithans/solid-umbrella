While the tech-heavy Nasdaq had help from eBay Inc\\'s upbeat earnings and a chipmaker rally, investors were digesting a mixed bag of reports. The S&P 500, closing roughly 0.5% below its intraday record high hit in late September, has rallied about 17% year-to-date. It has been supported by a dovish Federal Reserve, hopes of a U.S.-China trade deal and largely upbeat earnings. But with big companies such as Microsoft Corp, Facebook Inc, reporting after the close on Wednesday and Amazon.com and Intel Corp reports on tap for Thursday afternoon many investors kept to the sidelines.\\n\"While the expectations are for good reports from all four of them recent strength and relative valuations are keeping people on the edge of their seat,\" Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.\\n\"There was no needle moving news today for people to be making bigger bets on anything after the big move we had yesterday.\"\\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 59.34 points, or 0.22%, to 26,597.05, the S&P 500 lost 6.43 points, or 0.22%, to 2,927.25 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 18.81 points, or 0.23%, to 8,102.02.\\nProfits of S&P 500 companies are expected to decline 1.1% for the first quarter, still a large improvement from the 2.3% drop estimated at the start of April. And nearly 78% of the 129 companies that have reported so far have surpassed earnings estimates, according to Refinitiv data.\\n\"The overall picture confirms the economy is on a steady footing. It\\'s skewing to the positive side,\" said Laura Kane, head of Americas thematic investing at UBS Global Wealth Management.\\n\"The market is taking a pause. We\\'ve a lot of earnings coming this week and next. There\\'s nothing today that would change the overall economic outlook.\"\\nOnly three of the S&P 500\\'s 11 major industry sectors ended the day in positive territory and Real Estate led the gainers with a 0.8% rise. Energy was the biggest decliner with a 1.6% drop.\\nThe technology sector lost its gains late in the session to close down 0.01 percent and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index closed up 0.95% after hitting an all-time high during the session. Texas Instruments Inc rose 1.8% after its quarterly report.\\nCaterpillar Inc fell 3% as rising costs hit margins in its construction equipment business and the company reported tepid sales in the Asia Pacific region.\\nAT&T Inc was the biggest drag on the S&P 500, declining 4% after the second-largest U.S. wireless carrier reported quarterly revenue below Wall Street estimates.\\nEBay jumped 5.5% after the company raised its full-year sales and profit forecasts.\\nAnadarko Petroleum Corp jumped 11.6%, providing the biggest boost to the S&P 500, after Occidental Petroleum Corp sought to scuttle Chevron Corp\\'s takeover of the company with a $57 billion bid.\\nBoeing Co closed up 0.38% even after scrapping its 2019 outlook and reporting quarterly revenue below estimates due to grounding of its 737 MAX jets.

Facebook set aside $3 billion to cover anticipated costs associated with the settlement, but said the charges could reach as high as $5 billion.\\nIf the settlement is in that range, it would be the largest civil penalty paid to the agency, said David Vladeck, a former FTC official now at Georgetown Law School.\\n\"Everyone expected there would be a substantial civil penalty in this case,\" said Vladeck. \"There\\'s no question that Facebook is going to have to settle this matter. Investors want this behind them.\"\\nThe accrual cut the company\\'s net income in the first quarter to $2.43 billion, or $0.85 per share.\\nExcluding the $3 billion it set aside, Facebook would have earned $1.89 a share, up from $1.69 the year prior and easily beating analysts\\' average estimate of $1.63 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\\nTotal first-quarter revenue rose 26 percent to $14.9 billion from $12.0 billion last year, compared to analysts\\' average estimate of $15.0 billion.\\nShares of Facebook rose 10 percent to $200.50 in after-hours trade, demonstrating the company\\'s resilience despite a series of scandals over improperly shared user data and propaganda that made it the target of political scrutiny across the globe.\\nThe company\\'s shares lost a third of their value last year, after executives first warned about costs associated with its drive to improve safety and slowing growth in revenue and operating margin.\\nTotal expenses in the first quarter were $11.8 billion, up 80 percent compared with a year ago. The operating margin fell to 22 percent from 46 percent a year ago, but would have been 42 percent without the one-time expense.\\n\"This is a strong report suggesting that advertisers still see value in Facebook\\'s platform, as they did before the controversies and scandals erupted,\" said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at financial markets platform Investing.com.\\nExecutives have forecast that expenses will grow 40 to 50 percent in 2019, but say they expect the downward trend to taper off after this year as revenue from new ways of pushing ads and facilitating transactions offset the security spending.\\nMonthly and daily users of the main Facebook app compared to last quarter were both up 8 percent to 2.38 billion and 1.56 billion, respectively.\\nEstimates were for 2.4 billion monthly users and 1.6 billion daily users, according to Refinitiv averages.

The number marks the second consecutive quarter of growth in the continent, after declines in the first half of 2018.\\n\\n\"Despite the negative media coverage and the new privacy regulations brought into Europe, Facebook continues to show stable user trends with growth in Europe this quarter on a sequential basis,\" said Christopher Rossbach, CIO of private investment firm J. Stern & Co., in an email Thursday.\\n\\nThe social media giant was quick to blame last year\\'s slowdown on Europe\\'s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, a massive privacy law that went into effect in May. The law aims to give consumers more control over their personal data, for example by requiring users to reaffirm a company\\'s privacy policy before using its platform. Facebook warned this would impact user growth.\\n\"[In] Europe, we saw the declines that we anticipated from GDPR,\" Facebook CFO David Wehner said on the company\\'s July 2018 earnings call. \"And I would say there, really, those impacts were purely due to the GDPR impact, not other engagement trends.\"\\nNow, there are signs those concerns were overblown. In a note published Thursday morning, analysts at Baird said Facebook\\'s 4 million new daily active users in Europe are \"a potential sign that the engagement impact of GDPR was transitory.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEurope\\'s rebound could bolster the case for more regulation, not least from Facebook itself. On Wednesday\\'s earnings call, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg reiterated his call for more privacy regulation like GDPR. Users, meanwhile, have consistently forgiven the company for seemingly endless privacy and security lapses over the past year.\\n\"Everyone talks about this distrust that they have of Facebook now but at the end of the day they\\'re simply hooked on this platform,\" said Gene Munster, managing partner at Loup Ventures, on CNBC\\'s Fast Money Wednesday.\\nWhere GDPR does appear to have a bigger impact is on Facebook\\'s advertising targeting strategy.\\n\"The number of people who have opted out on using context from the apps and websites that they visit for ad targeting has continued to increase since the adoption of GDPR, so we\\'ve seen that come up both in Europe and around the world,\" Wehner said on Wednesday\\'s earnings call.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nshow chapters\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t    \\t                 \\n            Loup Ventures Gene Munster breaks down Facebook earnings020202\\n\\t\\t\\t                         5:33  PM ET Wed, 24 April 2019 |  02:42 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.mpsinit=mps._queue.mpsinit||[]; \\n    mps._queue.mpsinit.push(function() { \\n      mps.insertComponent(\\'#taboola_article_you_may_like\\', \\'taboola-article-you-may-like\\') \\n    });\\n'],\n",

The strong result \"speaks to the strength of its engagement, ad offering and ability to drive earnings power ... even while aggressively investing to improve its platform.\"\\nDigging into the numbers, Facebook sales, monthly active users and average revenue per user all topped estimates in the quarter. That was enough to draw an upgrade from UBS analyst Eric Sheridan, who changed his rating on Facebook shares to buy from neutral.\\n\"We continue to see FB as a core large cap Internet holding for strong revenue growth at reasonable valuation multiples against 2-3 year growth,\" he wrote. \"Based on our analysis, medium-term growth opportunities (Instagram, Video & Messenger) are under-appreciated relative to peers.\"\\nFacebook\\'s profit, revenue and user numbers hit record highs during the quarter. Facebook shares closed at $182.58 on Wednesday.\\nHere\\'s a wrap of all the major analyst opinions.\\n\\n\\n\\nUBS (buy; $240 target)\\n\\n\"While 2019 remains a year of transition, FB mgmt has now produced multiple quarters with ahead of consensus revenue/EPS performance (we believe driven by user/engagement/revenue growth on Instagram). Instagram is now one of the Internet\\'s large scaled digital ad platforms that can sustain growth & operating leverage (even as the platform transitions to Stories/Shopping) for years to come. While concerns will persist about core Facebook maturation, regulatory headwinds and/or safeguarding the platform for a privacy first approach, we think the market now better understands many of those risks (as they dominate almost all of our investor conversations).\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCiti (buy; $212 target)\\n\\n\"FB reported strong 1Q19 results, with revenue slightly ahead of even the most bullish expectations and expense growth slowing more than most expected ... All in, we see a combination of solid topline growth and improving expense trends to result in a 20% 3-yr revenue CAGR, stabilizing margins in 2020, and >$8 in GAAP EPS in 2020. With the equity currently valued at 24x our 20E GAAP EPS and with strong/improving fundamentals, we maintain our Buy rating.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nMorgan Stanley (buy; $210 target)\\n\\n\"What a start to 2019: FB\\'s strong start to 2019 C across the board 1Q revenue, free cash flow, EPS and active user beats C speaks to the strength of its engagement, ad offering and ability to drive earnings power...even while aggressively investing to improve its platform safety/security, product offerings, and monetization. We were particularly impressed by the 32% free cash flow beat as strong top-line and more capex/opex discipline drove upside. Advertising upside was driven by broad strength across Instagram News Feed, Stories and core Facebook News Feed (where pricing continues to rise).\"\\n\\n\\n\\nJ.P. Morgan (overweight; $245 target)\\n\\n\"We believe 1Q represents another qtr in which FB showed its ability to maintain strong engagement & also effectively manage revenue deceleration, which should give the Street increased confidence going forward. We continue to believe that FB can deliver 20\\'s% revenue growth in 2020 w/moderating expense growth, driving strong re-acceleration in earnings growth next yearwe model ~17% growth ex-accrual.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nGoldman Sachs (buy; $228 target)\\n\\n\"Buy-rated Facebook reported 1Q19 revenue above expectations. Total ad revenue of $14.91bn came in above the Street, with FactSet consensus of $14.78bn. While management accrued $3bn in the quarter for an FTC settlement, if we exclude this one-time item, GAAP operating margins would have been 42% (vs. 22% reported) which easily surpassed the Street forecast of 35.9%. GAAP EPS including the accrual was $0.85, however if we exclude this non-tax deductible accrual GAAP EPS would have been $1.89 which compares to consensus of $1.62. Below the line items were a $0.03 headwind to EPS in the quarter.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBank of America Merrill Lynch (buy; $187 target)\\n\\n\"Results were quite strong, though call commentary that privacy would impact revenue growth in 2H\\'19 and that Facebook remains committed to investing in 2019 \"and 2020\" may take away some of the trading momentum on potential for positive estimate revisions. Still with Facebook again beating its 1Q revenue outlook and lowering its expense guide, Street may see commentary as conservative. With revenue growth rates exceeding expectations (only a modest 2 points of q/q deceleration from shift to stories) we reiterate our Buy and remain optimistic on stories, messaging and video monetization, while expense growth is likely near a y/y peak.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBarclays (overweight; $240 target)\\n\\n\"Facebook reported revenue ~1% and OI (ex-fine) 18% above consensus in 1Q. Shares remain under-owned among the long-only community based on our conversations, so we may start to see a \"performance chasing\" dynamic as shares continue to ascend. The tone of the call was upbeat and Zuckerberg did a very good job explaining his longer-term vision which should put to rest some of the confusion following the early March manifesto. Stepping back, at 20x 2020 EPS, given the light LO positioning, we still see FB as one of the more compelling ideas in mega cap internet.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nDeutsche Bank (buy; $220 target)\\n\\n\"We feel better about Facebook\\'s medium term top line trajectory given lower-than-feared deceleration in 1Q (2.2ppts), skepticism around management\\'s guidance for greater 2H sequential growth deceleration, increased advertisers in Stories (3M vs 2M last quarter), and reduced customer concentration. Opex and capex growth already look to be moderating and the reduced guidance still looks conservative to us as it implies re-accelerating opex despite easier comps.

Total ad revenue of $14.91bn came in above the Street, with FactSet consensus of $14.78bn. While management accrued $3bn in the quarter for an FTC settlement, if we exclude this one-time item, GAAP operating margins would have been 42% (vs. 22% reported) which easily surpassed the Street forecast of 35.9%. GAAP EPS including the accrual was $0.85, however if we exclude this non-tax deductible accrual GAAP EPS would have been $1.89 which compares to consensus of $1.62.

Still with Facebook again beating its 1Q revenue outlook and lowering its expense guide, Street may see commentary as conservative. With revenue growth rates exceeding expectations (only a modest 2 points of q/q deceleration from shift to stories) we reiterate our Buy and remain optimistic on stories, messaging and video monetization, while expense growth is likely near a y/y peak.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBarclays (overweight; $240 target)\\n\\n\"Facebook reported revenue ~1% and OI (ex-fine) 18% above consensus in 1Q.

The tone of the call was upbeat and Zuckerberg did a very good job explaining his longer-term vision which should put to rest some of the confusion following the early March manifesto. Stepping back, at 20x 2020 EPS, given the light LO positioning, we still see FB as one of the more compelling ideas in mega cap internet.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nDeutsche Bank (buy; $220 target)\\n\\n\"We feel better about Facebook\\'s medium term top line trajectory given lower-than-feared deceleration in 1Q (2.2ppts), skepticism around management\\'s guidance for greater 2H sequential growth deceleration, increased advertisers in Stories (3M vs 2M last quarter), and reduced customer concentration. Opex and capex growth already look to be moderating and the reduced guidance still looks conservative to us as it implies re-accelerating opex despite easier comps.

GAAP EPS including the accrual was $0.85, however if we exclude this non-tax deductible accrual GAAP EPS would have been $1.89 which compares to consensus of $1.62.

As of Tuesday, just 129 companies, or 26% of the S&P had reported.\\n\\nAs of April 1, the expected decline was 2% from last year.\\nWhile it\\'s still early, some analysts say earnings revisions went too far, and the quarter should turn out to have positive growth.\\n\"It would appear, given both the early trend in 1Q\\'19 reporting and the notable increase in outlook for profit growth over the next twelve months, that forecasts of an \\'earnings recession\\' were premature,\" wrote Strategas Research\\'s Nicholas Bohnsack.\\nJ.P. Morgan strategists said the outlook for earnings was too pessimistic, and they expected the decline in first-quarter profits to turn around by the end of the reporting period, with S&P 500 companies delivering a 4% to 5% earnings surprise and profit growth of 2% to 3%.\\nThere have been high-profile winners and losers. On Thursday morning, 3M missed on the top and bottom lines and had a disappointing forecast. Facebook and Microsoft, on the other hand, beat their forecasts Wednesday afternoon. Facebook shares were up more than 5% Thursday while 3M was down 12%.\\nOn average, Refinitiv data shows earnings have come in 5.9% above estimates, a higher-than-typical earnings surprise factor, which has been 5.4% over the past four quarters. So far, 78% of companies have reported better than expected earnings results, well above the long-term average of 65%.\\nRevenue growth has averaged 4.1%, but the blended version, which includes those that have not yet reported, would be a 5% increase if companies meet forecasts.

Analysts polled by Refinitiv expected a profit of $2.49 per share on sales of $8.025 billion. The company also cut its guidance for 2019 and announced layoffs for 2,000 workers.\\n\\nAmerican Express  American Express shares rose 1.6% after an analyst at Morgan Stanley upgraded it to overweight from equal-weight. The analyst cited strong revenue growth moving forward for the upgrade.\\nUnited Parcel Service  Shares of the shipping giant dropped 8.1% after missing its earnings and revenue missed Wall Street forecasts. Snowstorms and heavy flooding in the Midwest disrupted operations last quarter, and UPS said it incurred roughly $80 million in extra costs to deal with those severe weather conditions.\\nSouthwest Airlines  The airline's shares rose 0.8% after the company's quarterly results beat analyst expectations despite taking a hit from the prolonged grounding of Boeing's 737 Max jets. The grounding, coupled with the impacts of the U.S. government shutdown, forced Southwest to cancel more than 10,000 flights last quarter.\\nComcast  Comcast shares climbed 2.6% after reporting first-quarter earnings that surpassed expectations. The media company reported adjusted earnings per share of 76 cents versus 68 cents expected in a Refinitiv survey. CNBC also reported, citing sources, that Comcast is in talks with Disney to sell its 30% stake in Hulu.\\nTesla  Tesla shares fell 4.3% after posting disappointing first-quarter results. The automotive company reported a loss of $2.90 on revenue of $4.54 billion. Refinitiv estimates expected a loss of 69 cents on revenue of $5.19 billion. The company noted weakening demand for electric vehicles.\\nMicrosoft  The tech giant's stock climbed 3.3% on the back of stronger-than-forecast quarterly numbers. Microsoft reported earnings per share of $1.14 on revenue of $30.6 billion. Analysts polled by Refinitiv expected a profit of $1 per share on sales of $29.84 billion.

That\\'s a big slowdown from 97% year-over-year growth last quarter, and over 100% growth for three consecutive quarters before that.\\nHowever, the rate of growth was artificially boosted in 2018 by an accounting change in January 2018. On an adjusted basis, the year-over-year growth rate in the \"Other\" segment in Q4 2018 was only 38%, and ranged between 51% and 73% in the previous quarters last year. So, while advertising growth has slowed, the drop-off was not as dramatic as it seemed to be from the company\\'s earnings statement.\\n\\nAmazon\\'s fast-growing advertising business has been a bright spot for the company amid slowing growth in its core e-commerce business.\\nAccording to figures from eMarketer, Amazon has become the number three digital advertiser in the U.S, behind only Alphabet\\'s Google and Facebook. CNBC previously reported that some consumer packaged goods advertisers were moving as much as half of their search ad budget from Google to Amazon, where an advertisement can be converted into an immediate sale on the site.\\nAs of February, Amazon was expected to take over 8.8% of net digital ad revenue share in the U.S. It still trails behind Google, which is expected to have 37.2% share this year, and Facebook, with an expected 22.1%, according to eMarketer.\\nAnalysts during the earnings call asked executives to comment on any supply and demand dynamics at play with the advertising business because of an apparent step down in the advertising business. Amazon\\'s chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky declined to elaborate on ad loads or inventory, but said the company is working to drive relevancy and serving useful ads.\\n\"Most of our focus has been on adding more functionality, adding more products and adding reporting for businesses and advertisers so they can understand the incremental customers we\\'re seeing through advertising with Amazon,\" he said. He added the company has been making operational improvements like adding tools, making better recommendations, making it easier to use Amazon demand-side platforms. \"We\\'re very focused on serving brands as well.\"\\nAnother asked if these improvements could re-accelerate growth, or if Amazon\\'s ads business is now facing the \"law of large numbers.\"\\n\"I wouldn\\'t comment on acceleration or deceleration of growth, I would just say we\\'re early on in this venture, it\\'s having a lot of pickup by both both vendors, sellers and also authors we feel like If we work on the inputs in this business and continue to grow traffic to the site, we will have a good outcome in the advertising space,\" Olsavsky said.\\nAmazon\\'s steady expansion beyond e-commerce has drawn fire from some politicians.\\nMost prominently, Democratic candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren in March unveiled a plan to break up Amazon and other tech giants, saying they have \"too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy.\" In particular, Warren has said Amazon plays a dual role of running a marketplace and selling its own products in it, creating a \"conflict of interest.\" Amazon removed some promotional spots for its own products earlier this year, possibly in response.\\nThe company revealed the numbers as it reported better-than-expected earnings Thursday. The stock barely moved after hours, as revenue was mostly in line with expectations and operating profit guidance for the second quarter was light.\\nUpdate: This story and its headline have been changed to reflect the fact that Amazon\\'s advertising growth rates were partly affected by an accounting change in Q1 2018. On an adjusted basis, growth rates did not drop as dramatically in Q1 2019 as originally stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nshow chapters\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t    \\t                 \\n            Amazon realizing the challenges of physical stores, says former Toys R Us CEO020202\\n\\t\\t\\t                        1 Hour Ago |  04:19 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.mpsinit=mps._queue.mpsinit||[]; \\n    mps._queue.mpsinit.push(function() { \\n      mps.insertComponent(\\'#taboola_article_you_may_like\\', \\'taboola-article-you-may-like\\') \\n    });\\n'],\n",

       "  'One of Amazon\\'s most promising new business areas, advertising sales, appears to be slowing down.\\n\\nThe growth of Amazon\\'s \"Other\" segment, which consists primarily of advertising sales, slowed dramatically to 36% in the first quarter from the previous year, at $2.72 billion. That\\'s a big slowdown from 97% year-over-year growth last quarter, and over 100% growth for three consecutive quarters before that.\\nHowever, the rate of growth was artificially boosted in 2018 by an accounting change in January 2018. On an adjusted basis, the year-over-year growth rate in the \"Other\" segment in Q4 2018 was only 38%, and ranged between 51% and 73% in the previous quarters last year. So, while advertising growth has slowed, the drop-off was not as dramatic as it seemed to be from the company\\'s earnings statement.\\n\\nAmazon\\'s fast-growing advertising business has been a bright spot for the company amid slowing growth in its core e-commerce business.\\nAccording to figures from eMarketer, Amazon has become the number three digital advertiser in the U.S, behind only Alphabet\\'s Google and Facebook. CNBC previously reported that some consumer packaged goods advertisers were moving as much as half of their search ad budget from Google to Amazon, where an advertisement can be converted into an immediate sale on the site.\\nAs of February, Amazon was expected to take over 8.8% of net digital ad revenue share in the U.S. It still trails behind Google, which is expected to have 37.2% share this year, and Facebook, with an expected 22.1%, according to eMarketer.\\nAmazon\\'s steady expansion beyond e-commerce has drawn fire from some politicians.\\nMost prominently, Democratic candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren in March unveiled a plan to break up Amazon and other tech giants, saying they have \"too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy.\" In particular, Warren has said Amazon plays a dual role of running a marketplace and selling its own products in it, creating a \"conflict of interest.\" Amazon removed some promotional spots for its own products earlier this year, possibly in response.\\nThe company revealed the numbers as it reported better-than-expected earnings Thursday. The stock barely moved after hours, as revenue was mostly in line with expectations and operating profit guidance for the second quarter was light.\\nUpdate: This story and its headline have been changed to reflect the fact that Amazon\\'s advertising growth rates were partly affected by an accounting change in Q1 2018. On an adjusted basis, growth rates did not drop as dramatically in Q1 2019 as originally stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nshow chapters\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t    \\t                 \\n            Amazon realizing the challenges of physical stores, says former Toys R Us CEO020202\\n\\t\\t\\t                        38 Mins Ago |  04:19 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.mpsinit=mps._queue.mpsinit||[]; \\n    mps._queue.mpsinit.push(function() { \\n      mps.insertComponent(\\'#taboola_article_you_may_like\\', \\'taboola-article-you-may-like\\') \\n    });\\n'],\n",

       "  'In this episode of ETF Spotlight, I talk with Nick Kalivas, Senior Equity Product Strategist at Invesco, about equal weighted ETFs.Market cap weighted ETFs are very popular with investors as they provide low cost, convenient ways to mimic the entire market or a particular segment of the market. However these ETFs are usually over-exposed to the largest and most expensive stocks. 02Nick explains the advantages and disadvantages of equal weighting versus market cap weighting.The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP  -  Free Report)\\t is the most popular equal-weight ETF. Equal weighting of its constituents results in sector exposures that differ significantly from the market cap weighted index. What do investors need to know?Since its inception in April 2003, RSP has beaten the S&P 500 index by over 70% on a cumulative basis, thanks mainly to its greater focus on value and small size.Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report)\\t, Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report)\\t and Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report)\\t together account for almost 11% of the S&P 500 but get only about 0.6% representation in RSP.Due to its underweighting to technology, the product lagged behind during periods of strong performance by tech heavyweights. Should investors expect it to perform like mid-cap ETFs with a value tilt? Should they expect it to outperform over longer holding periods?We also discuss if equal weighting makes more sense for large cap ETFs since mid and small cap ETFs do not have a lot of single stock risk.In November last year, Invesco launched S&P 500 Equal Weight Communication Services ETF (EWCO  -  Free Report)\\t. This is an interesting choice for investors looking for exposure to the new sector that was created after GICS realignment. The market cap weighted index for this new sector has almost 43% allocation to just two massive companiesFacebook (FB  -  Free Report)\\t and Googles Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report)\\t.Invesco has an interesting suite of alternatively weighted ETFs. Is there any particular form of weighting that investors should consider in the current market environment?Finally, we discuss how investors should use equal weighted and other alternatively weighted ETFs in their portfolios.Please visit invesco.com to learn more about these ETFs and other Invesco products.02 Make sure to tune in for our next podcast and also subscribe.

Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.72%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.56%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the social media company had gained 1.66% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 7.18% and the S&P 500's gain of 5.68% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from FB as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be April 24, 2019. In that report, analysts expect FB to post earnings of $1.65 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 2.37%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $14.96 billion, up 24.98% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $7.54 per share and revenue of $68.84 billion, which would represent changes of -0.4% and +23.29%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for FB. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.08% lower. FB currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Digging into valuation, FB currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 23.2. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 25.5, so we one might conclude that FB is trading at a discount comparatively.Also, we should mention that FB has a PEG ratio of 1.28. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Internet - Services industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 3.34 as of yesterday's close.The Internet - Services industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 194, putting it in the bottom 24% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

       "  '2018 was tough for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). Though the social network\\'s stock hit an all-time high of $218.62 last summer, it finished the year 26% lower than it started as investors worried about the company\\'s decelerating growth and rising operating costs amid its efforts to improve security and privacy on its platform.But sentiment toward Facebook has improved significantly this year, with shares up a whopping 36% year to date. This strong rebound, of course, puts immense pressure on the company\\'s first-quarter update. Investors will be looking for Facebook to show that its strong growth story is still intact.Here\\'s an overview of some specific areas to watch when Facebook reports results later this month.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg at F8 2018. Image source: Facebook.Though Facebook\\'s revenue growth has been decelerating recently, growing 30% year over year in Q402compared to 49% growth in the first quarter of 2019,02the pace of deceleration moderated in Q4. In Q2 and Q3 of last year, for instance, Facebook\\'s year-over-year revenue growth rates were 42% and 33%, respectively. These growth rates represented a significant slowdown compared to 49% year-over-year growth in Q1. Fourth-quarter year-over-year revenue growth of 30%, therefore, may have been slower but it highlighted resilience in the company\\'s strong top-line growth.To this end, Facebook\\'s fourth-quarter revenue of $16.9 billion came in at the high end of management\\'s guidance and beat analysts\\' expectations.02Management had guided for fourth-quarter revenue to rise 24% to 30%.For Facebook\\'s first quarter, management said it expected revenue to rise 24% to 26% year over year. Given the market\\'s growing optimism for the stock recently, investors should look for revenue growth for the period to be close to the high end of this range.Facebook\\'s operating expenses jumped sharply in 2018, rising 51% year over year. Expenses climbed particularly rapidly toward the end of the year, soaring 62% in Q4 to $9.1 billion.\"In addition to continued investment in infrastructure, safety and security, and innovation, expenses were also driven by seasonal factors -- including marketing efforts,\" explained CFO David Wehner in the company\\'s fourth-quarter earnings call.Further investment in investment in infrastructure, safety, and security are expected to result in more sharp expense growth in 2019, with management guiding for expenses to rise 40% to 50% compared to 2018. Investors, therefore, should look for operating expenses to rise at a rate within this range.Finally, investors should check on Facebook\\'s user growth, particularly the company\\'s measure of monthly active users across its entire family of social networks, which includes Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. Facebook said 2.7 billion people used at least one of its apps in December, with more than 2 billion active daily. Approximately 2.5 billion and 2.6 billion users interacted with at least one of these apps in Q2 and Q3, respectively. Can this metric hit 2.8 billion in Q1?Facebook is scheduled to report its first-quarter results on Wednesday, April 24, after the market closes.\\n'],\n",

       "  'It\\'s no secret that Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) has mastered the art of online sales to become the leader in the space. Not content to rest on its laurels, the company has set out to disrupt a growing number of other industries. Amazon also leads the cloud-computing industry and the smart-speaker category, both of which it pioneered.These business successes have helped the stock reach new levels. Late last year, Amazon briefly became only the second U.S. public company to exceed a $1 trillion market cap.Now, Amazon has its sights set on advertising, and while it\\'s still very early in the game, the company is quickly becoming a force to be reckoned with. It appears that Amazon\\'s ad business is taking share from its biggest rival Google, a division of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG).Image source: Getty Images.Advertisers are beginning to shift some of their ad dollars to Amazon at the expense of Google, according to a recent report in The Wall Street Journal. The world\\'s largest ad buyer, WPP PLC, reportedly spent an estimated $300 million on Amazon ads in 2018, up from between $100 million and $150 million in 2017.About 75% of that total came at the expense of Google, the report said. That\\'s still just a small part of the $3 billion-plus the agency spent on Google advertising last year, but it does show that the landscape is starting to shift in Amazon\\'s favor.02It also seems to confirm earlier reports that advertisers were moving a growing portion of their digital ad budgets from Google and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to Amazon, which helped the company become the third largest digital ad platform in the U.S.Google and Facebook are widely considered to have a virtual duopoly in the digital-ad market, garnering an estimated 38% and 21% of the market, respectively.02However, a look at Amazon\\'s advertising revenue shows just how quickly it\\'s growing -- up 117% year over year and topping $10 billion in 2018.PeriodQ1 18Q2 18Q3 18Q4 18Net sales$2.03 billion$2.19 billion$2.49 billion$3.39 billionYear-over-year growth139%132%122%95%Data source: Amazon\\'s Fourth-Quarter Financial Release.Google has been dealing with a number of controversies in recent years that have advertisers seeking other options. Earlier this year, YouTube -- the company\\'s video-sharing service -- terminated more than 400 channels after it was reported that child predators were making inappropriate comments on videos aimed at children.02The company faced several major boycotts by advertisers after their products were paired on YouTube with videos that promoted hate speech and extremist views.02The European Union (EU) has also assessed several record-breaking fines, alleging that Google continues to run afoul of European antitrust rules.Facebook has also seen its share of difficulties. The company is facing a growing list of allegations regarding the misuse of user data. Facebook has also been criticized for spreading hate speech and allowing political operatives in Russia to spread propaganda in an attempt to influence the U.S. presidential election.02Most recently, the company sparked outrage for live streaming a mass shooting in New Zealand.The negative spotlight on the two biggest digital advertisers has created an opening for Amazon, and it\\'s doing its best to leverage that opportunity.The company has a distinct advantage when it comes to advertising. More than half of consumers now begin their product search on Amazon rather than Google.02Once a customer searches for a product on the e-commerce website, advertised or \"promoted\" products appear first -- and consumers are only one click away from a purchase. This gives advertisers a captive audience within its targeted demographic that could produce a significant return on their advertising investments.The growing body of anecdotal evidence and the massive growth of the company\\'s ad revenue show that digital advertising is the next industry being disrupted by Amazon. Although it probably won\\'t be the last.\\n'],\n",

       "  \"Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report)\\t, a household name that is synonymous with smartphone chips, has decided to throw its hat in the ring for data center chips. Leveraging its mobile expertise, Qualcomm intends to replicate its success story within the data center chip market by offering AI-powered chips that form the fundamental building blocks of cloud computing.What Inspired the Strategic Plunge?Over the past few quarters, Qualcomm has been witnessing dwindling sales due to lackluster demand trends in the smartphone market and continued legal battles with Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report)\\t, which put its technology licensing business in jeopardy. Although the global smartphone market is expected to see muted growth over the next three to four years, major portion of this is likely to come from the low-cost emerging markets, weighing on Qualcomms margins. Moreover, the company has been facing stiff challenges from low-cost chip manufacturers like MediaTek and Rockchip as well as handset manufacturers SoC (System on Chip) projects such as Exynos by Samsung.In addition, there appears to be a huge demand-supply imbalance as semiconductor firms jostle to either optimize the traditional products on offer or develop new solutions altogether to meet the burgeoning data requirements of cloud computing firms like Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report)\\t, Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report)\\t and Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report)\\t. The need for high-power AI-driven data center chips have surged exponentially as firms like Facebook reportedly makes 200 trillion predictions daily, making it unsustainable to cater to such demands with existing pool of products.It seems that the strategic decision to tap a new market segment, which is likely to swell to $17 billion by 2025, was largely driven by an innate desire to reverse the downtrend in business and capitalize on a huge revenue-generating potential.Game On?The rival firms have also taken a note of such gold mines and are geared up to take the bull by the horns. Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report)\\t, Qualcomms nemesis in its fight against Apple, has taken recourse to inorganic growth strategies to gobble up smaller frays in the market to come up with different types of chips. In addition, it is ramping up the capabilities of its existing products to better handle the deluge of data.NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report)\\t, another competitor of Qualcomm, has fortified its graphics chips for data center use by investing significantly in the business. The company expects High Performance Computing and data centers to witness tremendous growth opportunities over the long run. NVIDIA intends to focus on new growth catalysts for its data center business, such as inference, data science and machine learning techniques to strengthen its presence in this niche market.Moving ForwardAlthough Qualcomm is yet to provide the finer details of the upcoming product dubbed the Cloud A1, it has apparently ruffled the feathers of the industry players with proposed features of 50x more powerful in processing AI workloads as its flagship mobile chip. The chip is likely to be instrumental for facilitating inferencing work that helps to make informed decisions based on analysis of data streams such as digitized voice or images.Whether Qualcomm can indeed benefit from such a revolutionary product remains to be seen. For the time being, we can safely assume that it has created a ripple in the market, with rival firms probably noting the entry of the industry veteran with apprehension.Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2019In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-holds for the year?Who wouldn't?

       "  \"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL C April 10, 2019 C Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Features:Lyft (LYFT  -  Free Report)\\t, Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report)\\t, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report)\\t and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report)\\t.IPO Enthusiasm Cools,02 but Apple & Facebook Roar Back to LifeThe highly anticipated Initial Public Offering of ride-sharing giant Lyft was promising at first, rallying well above the already-increased IPO price of $72/share and settling the first day up just a bit under 9%.Thats generally just about the right amount for a healthy offering because its a nice reward for early investors, but not such a huge gain that it appears that the offering company left big money on the table in an underpriced deal.Unfortunately, its been rough sailing since then for the former tech unicorn and the shares are currently trading 4% below the offering price C though still well above the valuation established by Lyfts final round of private financing in 2017.Lyft has threatened legal action against Morgan Stanley, accusing the brokerage of selling a derivative product that allowed insiders and short sellers to synthetically sell shares prior to the expiration of the lockup. Morgan denies encouraging shorting, but the fact that theres selling pressure on the shares at all C regardless of the vehicle C portends rough seas ahead for Lyft and potentially the rest of the IPO hopefuls as well.Lyfts performance has dampened expectations for the offerings of several other expected IPOs of highly valued tech companies - Uber, Airbnb and Pinterest, as well as dozens of other planned 2019 offerings.On Monday, Pinterest announced in its updated preliminary prospectus that it planned to sell 75 million shares at a range of $15-17/share, below prior expectations and roughly equivalent to its most recent private equity valuation.Analysts sometimes anticipate that in an environment when billions of dollars of new shares become available for trading for the first time, the price of established companies will suffer as cash is reallocated out of existing companies and into the new offering.Thats definitely not the case for tech giants Apple and Facebook, both of which have made significant recoveries from 2018 lows and are now in the midst of their own strong rallies, outpacing whats already been a hot start for the broad markets in 2019.After suffering from an apparent slowdown in iPhone sales (Apple) and privacy and regulatory concerns (Facebook), they have now gained 28% and 36% respectively in 2019 and investors have definitely regained their taste for shares of the biggest tech stocks.The takeaway seems to be that while its easy to get excited about the offering of shares of the private companies that have become household names while earning private equity valuations well north of a billion dollars, theres no substitute for earnings.Even after the recent rally, Apple still trades at a forward P/E ratio of 17X C roughly the same as the S&P 500 C and Facebook only slightly higher at 23X.Both Apple and Facebook report quarterly results at the end of the month, and for now, investors are showing a clear preference for the stability of big earnings, even as flashier new stocks become available.Today's Best Stocks from Zacks Would you like to see the updated picks from our best market-beating strategies?
