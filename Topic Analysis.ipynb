       "  'It has been rumored in the media by people with inside knowledge of the matter that Huawei is open to selling its Balong 5G modems to Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report)\\t.This isnt perhaps too surprising, given that Apple has come out underprepared to meet the 5G market by virtue of its dependence on Intel (INTC  -  Free Report)\\t, which has been notoriously slow to meet its production targets of late.Intel was expected to have its 8160 5G modem ready for Apple to work on this year with the final chip to ship next year. This would allow Apple to launch its 5G phone next year, when most networks would acquire 5G capability as well.It wouldnt have been a moment too soon, as almost everybody else will have a 5G capable smartphone shipping this year based on Qualcomms (QCOM  -  Free Report)\\t technology, or their internally developed chips.But Intel is reportedly seeing even more delays and Apples internal developments arent ready yet.Moreover, of all the companies that could have supplied Apple, Qualcomm would have been the obvious choice because of the long standing partnership between the two. But that relationship soured after Apple took Qualcomm to court. Now, Qualcomm would likely demand a settlement if it is to supply any chips.The second in line would be Samsung, which is a \"frenemy\" of Apple\\'s, in that it supplies chips to the iPhone maker on the one hand, and competes with it in the smartphone market on the other. Samsung likely doesnt have the volumes that Apple would require anyway, so this source is also ruled out.Mediatek is a company that could perhaps supply the volumes, but its chips are normally used in lower end phones.That leaves Huawei, which has seen growing popularity both in Asia and Europe to the extent that it is now vying with Samsung to become the leading global supplier. Mr. Trump and his security officials see plenty of risk in Huawei selling telecom equipment in the U.S. because of information leaking out to China.So supplying to Apple would allow the company to make some money in the region. But whether Apple (or Americans, for that matter) will allow this to happen is another story. Some users are already threatening to leave Apple if it engages with Huawei.But Apple does have another option. It could stick with Intel for America and use Huawei technology in other markets, where people dont consider it a security risk. This actually makes a lot of sense because 1) Apple is losing share in China and has next to no share in India, the two biggest smartphone markets 2) with penetration rates going up, smartphone demand has been declining and the higher speeds and lower latency that 5G brings makes it a big reason to upgrade 3) its advantageous for Apple to continue to build its installed base because of its new focus on the services business.Apple shares carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of todays Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will you retire a millionaire?One out of every six people retires a multimillionaire.

       "  'Everyone seems to want a piece of your TV time, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Will its efforts resonate? Here\\'s what we know about the company\\'s recently unveiled Apple TV+ service as of this writing:Really, there are only two things we don\\'t know: when Apple TV+ will launch officially (\"this fall\" is the date we have as of today), and what a subscription will cost. I think Apple CEO Tim Cook is better off never answering those questions and instead writing a check for $10 billion to $15 billion to buy Roku outright and remake Apple TV+ as the Roku Channel. Here\\'s why.You may have heard that Apple TV+ won\\'t get Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) because the streaming king doesn\\'t want to give Apple  or anyone else  access to its data, and Apple TV+ content is to be run through Apple\\'s servers. Were Netflix to cave, it would mean giving the iEmpire unfettered -- and invaluable --02access to millions of terabytes of data about its customers\\' viewing habits.Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is set to be one of many options for Apple TV+ viewers. Image source: Apple.Now imagine Apple acquiring Roku and making Apple TV+ with its original content a featured channel and selling access as part of the hardware bundle. (\"Buy an Apple Roku player and get both Apple TV+ and the Roku Channel, free,\" they might say.) Netflix, which has long been available through Roku, could remain on the platform without streaming its data through Apple servers. Everyone wins.Even better, Apple would be putting its service out in the wild  i.e., unbundling the service from the device  just as Roku is getting traction for being the most widely used TV operating system, with a 37% share of the streaming player market, according to a recent Parks Associates survey.02Apple could leverage that installed base to bring its content to more people, faster, than it ever could building from scratch.There\\'s also the data. So what if Apple couldn\\'t touch Netflix? Buying Roku would still provide access to the viewing habits of millions who watch Roku TV and Roku TV ads. Not just what sorts of ads, but where those ads are viewed: on TV, on a computer, on a mobile device, etc. All that context can help shape and inform how Apple builds its next iPhones and iPads for TV-watching consumers.Roku\\'s Ultra player looks a lot like an Apple TV. Image source: Roku.Roku, for its part, has done a masterful job building an audience  streaming hours jumped 69% in the fourth quarter  but still suffers from low margins on device sales.\"You should expect us to manage the player gross margin to low single-digits margins in 2019,\" Chief Financial Officer Steve Louden said during the Q4 conference call with analysts. \"We remind you that we are not optimizing for player gross profit given our focus on account growth. And our strategy of trading player margin for account growth and platform revenue growth is working well.\"Translation: Roku is going to make its margins on subscriptions and advertising, but not on sales of its lineup of streaming video players. Apple\\'s experience building hardware at scale could help squeeze more from each player while the two work on building the world\\'s largest and most consumer-friendly digital entertainment ecosystem -- one that\\'s also built for high-performance advertising.What would that mean for competitors? Netflix would have a big decision to make, since it remains the most-streamed app on Roku and relies on the device for a significant amount of eyeballs every month.02Amazon may be threatened by Apple\\'s sudden scale, and Alphabet02could02be left searching for scraps in the market for TV ad inventory.Or not. The choice here is Apple\\'s: Stay with a \"maybe someday\" strategy that leaves fans wondering what to think, or excite some (but maybe not all) of the base with a broad new offering that includes the best work of a fast-growing and imaginative industry pioneer. As a longtime Apple shareholder, I\\'d prefer the latter.\\n'],\n",

Qualcomm shares soared in response, and that investor enthusiasm continued today, with Qualcomm stock gaining 12.3% and Apple rising 2%. The financial specifics of the deal were not revealed, but Apple agreed to a payment to Qualcomm and the companies signed a six-year license agreement with a two-year option to extend.Apple had objected to Qualcomm's licensing model, which resulted in higher payments as iPhone prices rose. The Mac maker had sued Qualcomm for anticompetitive practices, and had instructed contract manufacturers to halt royalty payments to the chipmaker. Qualcomm countersued, and the feuding tech giants began their trial just this week.The settlement was a win for both companies, but especially for Qualcomm, whose stock was immediately upgraded by multiple analysts. Apple had begun using modem chips from Intel, making a significant impact on Qualcomm's business. Intel announced yesterday evening that it intends to exit the 5G smartphone modem business, giving Qualcomm clear sailing to dominate the market for those devices as 5G rolls out.Netflix02beat its guidance for subscription additions and profit margin in the first quarter, but its forecast for the second quarter stirred some concern, and shares closed down 1.3%. Revenue increased 22.2% to $4.52 billion, topping its guidance02of $4.49 billion. The company grew paying subscribers 6.9% by adding 9.6 million paying subscribers -- a record -- after setting expectations for 8.9 million. Of that total, 1.74 million were in the U.S. and 7.86 million were international.Operating margin was 10.2%, down from 12.1% in Q1 last year, but above its forecast of 8.9%. Earnings per share rose 18.8% to $0.76. Free cash outflow was $460 million, and Netflix raised its estimate for full-year outflow from $3 billion to $3.5 billion.The company caused some concern by forecasting 5 million subscriber additions next quarter, down from 5.45 million adds in the period a year ago, partly due to price increases in the U.S. But Netflix investors have seen this movie before, and this time mostly shrugged off the prospect of a short-term slowdown in subscriber additions.\\n\"],\n",

Intel announced this move shortly after Qualcomm and Apple laid down their swords, and at first glance Intel\\'s announcement seems like bad news. Multiple analysts, however, say today that in their view at least, Intel is making the right move here.As a result, Intel stock closed Wednesday up 3.3%, after rising 5.1% earlier in the day.Image source: Getty Images.So who are these analysts, and what are they saying? According to reports by TheFly.com today, KeyBanc is one of Intel\\'s fans, and KeyBanc was never a big fan of Intel getting into 5G cellphone modems. This is a low-margin business that Intel is exiting, says KeyBanc, and it made \"little strategic sense\" for Intel to get into it in the first place. Plus, Intel was behind schedule in developing 5G modems, and probably would have lost out to Qualcomm in any case.Thus, Intel made the right call in cutting bait and abandoning 5G.Wells Fargo seconded that view, calling Intel\\'s exit a \"positive\" for the stock.Intel CEO Bob Swan summed up his decision as follows: \"We are very excited about the opportunity in 5G and the \\'cloudification\\' of the network, but in the smartphone modem business it has become apparent that there is no clear path to profitability and positive returns.\"  Intel\\'s early decision to gracefully concede the 5G smartphone modem market to Qualcomm offers the best chance of Intel avoiding negative returns that threatened to continue pressuring its gross margins (already below 61%), and to reverse the positive momentum Intel has enjoyed in operating and net margins these past two years.

The company added 9.6 million net paid accounts during the quarter, driving revenue 22% above the year-ago period\\'s while earnings increased by 19%.Netflix\\'s management also provided important updates on several fronts, including the company\\'s view of new competitors. Let\\'s have a closer look at the first quarter of 2019.Image source: Netflix.In the first quarter, Netflix increased its top line by 22% to $4.52 billion. Earnings rose 19% year over year, landing at $344 million, or $0.76 per diluted share. These results compare favorably to02the company\\'s guidance targets, which pointed to earnings near $0.56 per share on sales of roughly $4.49 billion.In terms of subscriber additions, Netflix added 9.6 million net paid subscribers on a global level. Guidance was aimed at 8.9 million. The company added 7.9 million international accounts and 1.7 million domestic subscribers. All told, the global number of streaming accounts grew 24% year over year, stopping at 148.9 million. Netflix also reported 2.6 million subscribers to its aging DVD service, down from 2.7 million last quarter and 3.1 million a year ago.Investors also keep a close eye on Netflix\\'s free cash flow. The company consumed $460 million of cash in the first quarter compared to $287 million in the year-ago period.Looking ahead, Netflix expects second-quarter earnings of approximately $0.55 per share on revenue in the neighborhood of $4.93 billion. Hitting those targets exactly would amount to year-over-year sales growth of 26% and 35% lower earnings. Paid subscriptions should grow by another 5 million, landing near 154 million accounts.Image source: Netflix.CEO Reed Hastings pointed to the usual growth engines behind these results. Consumers around the world are enjoying Netflix\\'s original content, which inspires steady subscriber growth over time even if monthly fees are rising in key markets like the U.S., Brazil, and some European countries.On the earnings call, Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos added some color to the international growth story:We had some great international breakouts where they really helped drive excitement. By way of example, Kingdom in Korea that did phenomenal and is getting watched all over the world and throughout the region. So we think we\\'ve been able to work on a very local basis and very global basis with the content this year, this quarter.That was a recurring theme in the earnings call. Netflix is going out of its way to create original content on a local level with as much authentic flavor as possible. In doing so, the company has found that audiences in other territories also flock to these sort-of-exotic movies and shows.\"The more authentically local the show is, the better it travels, which we\\'ve seen with Kingdom,\" Sarandos said. He continued:Fans of K-Drama around the world have loved that show and it resonated incredibly well for us in Korea. Similarly, coming up we have a new season of The Rain coming out this quarter that is perfectly Swedish. We don\\'t try to water it down or make it travel any better inorganically and we found that the best way to make global stories is to make them incredibly authentically local.As expected, Hastings spent some time discussing how his company is reacting to the upcoming launches of video-streaming services from Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).02Also as expected, he largely brushed them off.\"Great competition makes you better,\" said Hastings. He added:And so, we\\'re thrilled to have Apple and Disney in, they are awesome companies and just to be in the same league as them is very exciting for us. And then on a practical basis, there\\'s already so much competition. I mean, we mentioned we only win 2% of downloading on mobile, it\\'s like 98% of the time people are not doing Netflix. On U.S. televisions, 90% are not watching Netflix. So there\\'s a ton of competition out there and Disney and Apple add a little bit more, but frankly I doubt it it will be material, because again there\\'s already so many competitors for entertainment time, which is great for consumers and it\\'s exciting for us.\\n'],\n",

       "  'SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Shipments of mobile phones to China fell 6 percent in March compared with the same year-earlier month, official figures showed on Wednesday, as slowing economic growth took a toll on the sector. The shipments dropped to 28.4 million units in March from 30.2 million units in March 2018, the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT) said. Marchs 6 percent slide follows four consecutive months of double-digit declines. The slowdown points to continued pressure on the likes of Apple Inc, which endured a steep drop in China sales in late 2018, and its domestic smartphone rivals. The number of new devices launched by phone makers also fell, according to CAICT. A total of 52 new handsets hit the market in the month, down 35 percent from a year earlier. Last year was an anemic one for the worlds largest mobile phone market, with total shipments falling 15.5 percent, CAICT data shows. The weakness continued in 2019 - February shipments totaled 14.5 million units, the lowest since February 2013 and a 19.9 percent decrease from a year earlier. Industry analysts generally attribute the weak performance to a slowdown in economic growth, longer upgrade cycles, and a lull in feature innovation as carriers focus on preparations for the launch 5G connectivity on their networks. To cope with the slowdown, Chinese domestic brands have been raising prices and moving upmarket, hoping to boost margins. In 2018, Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, Oppo, and Vivo each captured a bigger share of the $500-to-$800 price range of phones, a segment once dominated by Apple. The U.S. brand, which currently generates over 15 percent of its revenue from Greater China, has suffered in particular from the slowdown. Sales from the region during the three-month period to the end of December 2018 fell by roughly a quarter from a year earlier. Several third-party retailers have lowered prices on a range of iPhone devices this year. Apple also lowered the official sticker price of its phones after China cut the rate of value-added tax on luxury goods.\\n'],\n",

       "  '(Reuters) - Apple Inc said on Thursday it has nearly doubled the number of suppliers using only clean energy for production work, including two that assemble and make the processor chips for the iPhone. Apple last year said it meets all of its needs with renewable energy such as solar farms that power data centers. But a large part of its carbon footprint comes from its supply chain, and since 2015 Apple has worked directly with those companies to use clean energy for Apple production. Forty-four companies are now in the program, Apple said on Thursday, including Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, whose Foxconn unit makes iPhones, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd, which supplies the A-series chips that power all of Apples mobile devices. Apple had previously disclosed 23 suppliers in the program.   The company defines clean energy as coming from wind, solar or bio-gas fuel cells, as well as what it calls low-impact hydroelectric projects like a site in Oregon that captures energy from water in irrigation canals to power one of its data centers.  Apple did not specify where the new suppliers in the program would get the clean energy. It encourages suppliers to build their own renewable energy projects, such as when iPad assembler Compal last year built rooftop solar installations on its factories in China.  When those options are not available, Apple says it aims to have suppliers sign power-purchase agreements with new renewable energy projects and using purchases of renewable energy credits only when there are no other options. In an interview, Lisa Jackson, Apples vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, said the company is also on track to pass its goal of adding 4 gigawatts of renewable energy to the grids of its supply chain by 2020 and has a sight line to well over 5 gigawatts. Jackson declined to say whether Apple would drop suppliers such as Foxconn and TSMC - whose capabilities few others in the global electronics supply chain can match - if they fail to meet their commitments to the program. It took a while for them to come on board, and so we believe that now that they have, theyre fully committed to doing it, Jackson said. And obviously if they fall down on the job, well be right there on their chase. I cant tell you what will happen, but I hope it never does.\\n'],\n",

Dutch competition agency ACM suggested the investigation may be expanded to Googles Play Store in future because of similar business practices by the company. Both services are lucrative money spinners for Apple and Google. The investigation was triggered by Dutch apps for news media which provided indications of possible anti-competitive behavior by the iPhone maker during the agencys study into app stores, ACM said. ACM will investigate, among other aspects, whether Apple acted in violation of the prohibition of abuse of dominance, for example, by giving preferential treatment to its own apps, the Dutch enforcer said in a statement. The investigation will also look into Apples requirement that app developers use its payment systems for in-app purchases and pay a 30 percent fee in the first year, and also difficulties app developers face in using all functionalities of an iPhone. ACM is calling on app providers to come forward if they experience any problems with Apples App Store, but also if they experience similar problems with Googles Play Store. ACM will use that information in its investigation, the Dutch watchdog said. Apple said it treats all app developers equally. We are confident (ACMs) review will confirm all developers have an equal opportunity to succeed in the App Store, the company said in a statement. Google declined to comment.

       "  'TOKYO (Reuters) - A Chinese-Taiwanese group will take control of Apple Inc supplier Japan Display after pumping in funds as part of a 232 billion yen ($2.1 billion) bailout plan for the troubled display panel maker. The rescue comes after previous, publicly funded bailouts failed to help the company cut its dependence on Apple, whose slowing iPhone sales have badly hit Japan Display. The deal will make the buyers Japan Displays biggest shareholders - with a 49.8 percent stake - replacing the Japanese government-backed INCJ fund and effectively ending the governments efforts to keep the last remaining domestic display maker out of foreign hands. The buyer group, which includes Taiwanese flat screen maker TPK Holding and Chinese investment firm Harvest Group, will inject up to 80 billion yen into Japan Display by buying shares and bonds. INCJ will also join the bailout by accepting a debt-to-preferred equity swap totaling 75 billion yen and extending senior loans worth 77 billion yen. After the deal its stake will fall to 12.7 percent from 25.3 percent. The deal could potentially be subject to a U.S. national security review at a time when Washington is stepping up its scrutiny on Chinese investment in the United States. Japan Display has a subsidiary in San Jose, a U.S. business that could give the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) jurisdiction over the deal.  Displays may not necessarily be critical technologies that are export controlled, but some of Japan Displays technologies such as fingerprint sensors could raise a national security concern, said Nancy Fischer and Matthew Rabinowitz, partner and senior associate, respectively, at U.S.-based law firm Pillsbury. Minoru Kikuoka, Japan Displays finance division head, told reporters at a briefing that the companys legal advisors have said a CFIUS filing would not be necessary. CFIUS, however, retains indefinite jurisdiction to request a filing and review the transaction, even after it closes. The bailout comes as sales of new iPhone models - many of which use newer organic light-emitting displays (OLED) - have left Japan Displays new factory that makes liquid crystal display (LCD) panels running at half capacity. Japan Display expects to post its fifth straight year of net losses in the year ending this month, as disappointing sales of Apples iPhone XR, the only model with an LCD screen, dashed hopes for a turnaround. The Apple business accounted for more than half of Japan Displays revenue over the last four years. Kikuoka said at the briefing, without naming Apple, that Japan Display still owes its client about 100 billion yen. The U.S. tech giant fronted most of the $1.5 billion construction costs for a new LCD factory three years ago. We discussed with our client, including that (repayment) issue as well, before we reached the agreement, Kikuoka said. Under the latest deal, Japan Display and Harvest Tech, part of the buyout group, are planning to jointly produce OLED panels, used in top-end iPhones, Japan Display said. Reuters reported earlier this month that Japan Display will begin supplying OLED screens for the Apple Watch later this year.   Japan Display was formed in 2012 by combining the LCD businesses of Hitachi Ltd, Toshiba Corp and Sony Corp in a deal brokered by the government. It went public in March 2014 and was worth more than 400 billion yen then. It is now worth 67 billion yen.\\n'],\n",

       "  '(Reuters) - Apple Inc and its allies on Monday will kick off a jury trial against chip supplier Qualcomm Inc in San Diego, alleging that Qualcomm engaged in illegal patent licensing practices and seeking up to $27 billion in damages.  Qualcomm, for its part, alleges that Apple forced its longtime business partners to quit paying some royalties and is seeking up to $15 billion. Filed by Apple in early 2017, the lawsuit in federal court revolves around the modem chips that connect devices like the iPhone or Apple Watch to wireless data networks. Qualcomm has spent the past two years mounting a pressure campaign of smaller legal skirmishes against Apple, seeking - and in some cases obtaining - iPhone sales bans for violating its patents. The trial before Judge Gonzalo Curiel will play out on Qualcomms home turf of San Diego, where for decades the citys National Football League team played in Qualcomm Stadium and nearly every business district hosts the mobile chip firms logo. For Apple, the trial is about the freedom to determine its own technology path for blockbuster products by buying chips without having to pay what it calls a tax on its innovations in the form of patent licensing fees to Qualcomm that take a cut of the selling price of its devices.  For Qualcomm, the trial, along with similar allegations from U.S. regulators in a January court hearing, will determine the fate of its unique blend of selling chips and licensing more than 130,000 patents.  Licensing generates most of Qualcomm profits. The model propelled Qualcomm from a small contract research and development shop when founded in 1985 to a global chip powerhouse important enough to U.S. national security that President Donald Trump personally intervened to prevent a hostile takeover of the company last year. This is the day of reckoning that Qualcomm has been very fortunate to avoid for many years, said Gaston Kroub, a patent attorney with Kroub, Silbersher & Kolmykov who is not involved in the case. In Apple, theyve finally come up against a potential licensee that has the resources and the will to put Qualcomms business model and licensing practices on trial. Qualcomm requires device makers to sign a license to its patents before it will supply chips, which it views as a commonsense measure to ensure it does not do business with companies violating its patents. But Apple and other device makers around the world have called the no license, no chips policy a form of double dipping - that is, charging for the same intellectual property once during licensing discussions, and then again in the price of the chips where the patents are embodied. Apple and allies are asking for an end to that practice and a refund of about $9 billion - an amount that could be tripled if a jury finds in Apples favor for antitrust allegations - for contract factories such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltds Foxconn, who paid the royalties and were reimbursed by Apple. Apple alleges the practices kept rivals like Intel Corp out of the market for years. Even very big companies like Intel have felt at a disadvantage, said Michael Salzman, an antitrust attorney with Hughes Hubbard & Reed not involved in the case. Qualcomm will argue that it had been working successfully with contract factories for years before Apple introduced its iPhone. But Apple used its heft in the industry to get those factories to break their longstanding contracts with Qualcomm, depriving it of at least $7 billion in royalties it was due, the chip supplier alleges.  The chip supplier will also argue that its licensing practices have been consistent for decades and only came under fire when Apple, known in the electronics industry for pushing suppliers to contain costs, took issue with it. A victory would secure Qualcomms status as a major technology provider for 5G, the next generation of mobile data networks coming online this year. I dont think (a Qualcomm victory) would be great for Apple, but if its about money, theyve got plenty of money, said Stacy Rasgon, an equity analyst for Bernstein who follows Qualcomm. For Qualcomm, its an existential attack on the meat of their business model.\\n'],\n",

Apple is behind rivals such as South Koreas Samsung Electronics Co and Huawei in delivering a phone equipped with fifth-generation (5G) modems that is expected to provide fresh momentum in a slumping global smartphone market. Intel Corp, the sole supplier of modem chips for iPhones, has said its 5G chips will not appear in mobile phones until 2020, raising the possibility that Apple, its biggest customer, will be more than a year behind rivals in delivering a device that uses the faster 5G networks. Samsung started selling 5G phones in South Korea this month ahead of the global introduction of 5G networks, and Huawei, whose smartphones outsold iPhones in the fourth quarter, plans to launch a 5G phone in June.

His comment comes a day after CNBC published here an interview with Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei that the firm was \"open\" to selling its 5G chips to Apple. Uncertainty over the availability of a 5G-equipped iPhone has weighed on the worlds most valuable company - at $939 billion - as rivals unveil products such as foldable phones in a bid to revive stalling smartphone sales. Brokerage UBS earlier this month said Apple, also battling falling iPhone sales, is increasingly in jeopardy of being unable to ship a 5G iPhone in 2020 which could cause near-term headwind for the company. Apple held talks with Samsung, Intel and Taiwans MediaTek Inc to supply 5G modem chips for 2019 iPhones, according to an Apple executives testimony at a trial between Qualcomm Inc and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission earlier this year. Huawei, also the worlds biggest telecoms equipment maker, said on Tuesday the number of contracts it has won to provide 5G telecoms gear increased further, in defiance of a U.S. campaign to squeeze the Chinese maker out of international markets on security grounds. The comments come a day after Reuters reported, citing sources and documents, that the United States will push allies at a meeting in Prague next month to adopt shared security and policy measures that will make it more difficult for Huawei to dominate fifth-generation (5G) telecommunications networks. Washingtons concerns center around a Beijing directive that all Chinese companies cooperate with state intelligence work. Huawei has said it would never share data with the government. Still, Huawei has secured 40 contracts to supply 5G gear as at March-end, from 30-plus disclosed last month, Hu said on Tuesday at the firms annual global analyst summit at its Shenzhen headquarters in southern China. Of the new total, Huawei signed 23 contracts in Europe, six in Asia-Pacific, 10 in the Middle East and one in Africa. Huawei also said has shipped over 70,000 5G base stations and expects to have shipped 100,000 by May.\\n'],\n",

Tens of billions of dollars and the fate of Qualcomms business model are at stake in the case. Apple alleges that Qualcomm engaged in illegal patent licensing practices to maintain a monopoly on the market for premium modem chips that connect smart phones to wireless data networks. Qualcomm in turn says Apple uses innovations that Qualcomm spent billions to develop without proper compensation and that Apple has interfered in Qualcomms longstanding business relationships.

       "  'SAN DIEGO, Calif. (Reuters) - Apple Inc and Qualcomm Inc on Tuesday opened  a complex trial with the iPhone maker using a fried chicken analogy to illustrate its claim the chip company is abusing  its market power while Qualcomm alleged a years-long plan by Apple to deprive it of billions in revenue, $13 at a time. The fate of Qualcomms business model, which involves licensing more than 130,000 patents in addition to selling chips, is at stake in the case, which consolidates related lawsuits and countersuits. Apple alleges that Qualcomms patent practices were an illegal move to maintain a monopoly on the market for premium modem chips that connect smart phones to wireless data networks.  Qualcomm in turn says Apple used its heft in the electronics business to wrongly order contract factories such as Hon Hai Precision Co Ltds Foxconn to withhold royalty payments from Qualcomm that Apple had historically reimbursed to the factories. A jury of three women and six men will hear the case over  five weeks in the San Diego federal courtroom of Judge Gonzalo Curiel. On Tuesday, attorneys sought to cut through the technological complexity and frame key elements of the case in terms the jury could understand. Apple has objected to a practice that it calls no license, no chips under which Qualcomm will not sell chips to a company that has not signed a patent license agreement.

You first have to go over to this different counter, KFL - Kentucky Fried Licensing, Cordell said. You have to go pay that eating license fee before theyll sell you any chicken. For its part, Qualcomm alleged that Apple bullied its contract manufacturers into choking off royalty payments to Qualcomm. Qualcomm had been doing business with those factories long before the iPhone, Qualcomm said. The idea that Qualcomm can bully Apple is absolutely remarkable, said Evan Chesler, Qualcomms attorney. Apple dwarf us in size, but they cut off that money. Qualcomm portrayed the move as part of a years-long Apple plan to weaken Qualcomms patent licensing business, showing jurors internal slides from Apple presentations where Apple talked of wanting to hurt Qualcomm financially. It was all planned in advance, every bit of it, Chesler said. Chesler also used iPhone price increases to $1,000 or more in recent years to frame Qualcomms technology licensing fees. Out of a $1,000 for that phone, what theyre not paying us is $13, Chesler said. What would your iPhone be worth to you if you stepped five feet to the right and the call dropped out?

       "  \"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Apple and Qualcomm have faced up to their mutual need. The $940 billion smartphone maker and $85 billion mobile-chip firm on Tuesday ended a two-year fight over royalties with a licensing agreement and a cash payment to Qualcomm. Apple cant risk being stuck with second-rate semiconductors in its devices, and Qualcomm has huge revenue at stake. At first blush, both sides benefit from the truce. Their lawyers have been kept busy since 2017 by the argument over how Qualcomm charges for chips that connect smartphones to data networks. Apple accused Qualcomm of withholding parts from suppliers unless they agreed to pay high royalties, something the iPhone maker said was anti-competitive. Qualcomm said Apple had put pressure on suppliers not to pay. The numbers were pretty big, even for such huge companies: Apple was seeking as much as $27 billion in damages, while its supplier-cum-adversary wanted up to $15 billion. The nature of the truce is hazy. Neither side is saying how big Apples payment is, or what future royalties will be. Qualcomm did point out in a presentation to investors, however, that it expects an incremental $2 per share of earnings; details on exactly how and when that flows through are nonexistent, but with 1.2 billion shares outstanding, that probably implies a hefty payment. History suggests Apple, meanwhile, will get sweeter terms than it had before the dispute. About a decade ago, then-dominant phone maker Nokia and Qualcomm settled a similar dispute with Nokia getting a discount. Investors seem to believe there are no losers. Apples shares rose slightly, adding around $1 billion to its market capitalization, reflecting that it will now have access to 5G chips from the dominant supplier. Thats better than the risk of delays in future iPhones, or worse, inferior handsets. Qualcomms market value jumped by $15 billion, or more than a fifth, as investors penciled in large, high-margin royalty payments down the road.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index gained for a sixth straight session with Frances CAC hitting a nearly 11-month high, while Londons FTSE 100 ended flat. Chinas economy grew at a steady 6.4 percent pace in the first quarter, defying expectations for a further slowdown, as industrial production surged and consumer demand showed signs of improvement. Analysts however, said it was too early to call a sustainable turnaround there, and further policy support would be needed to maintain momentum. The positive China data spurred demand for carmakers and suppliers in the region with the auto index touching near seven-month highs. It all has to do with better data from China because car imports basically collapsed in China recently, so if retail sales are better its a hope that car sales will pick up, said Teeuwe Mevissen, Senior Market Economist at Rabobank. The data also pushed Germanys 10-year government bond yield to a four-week high, helping banks record a fifth-straight day of gains. In contrast to all that confidence, the German government significantly lowered the countrys economic growth for 2019 on account of cooling global economy, increased trade conflicts and Brexit affecting Germanys exports. Despite the lower growth outlook for Germany there remains risk-on sentiment, said Mevissen. Among individual stocks, power grid maker ABB was among the top gainers on STOXX after Chief Executive Ulrich Spiesshofer quit the Swiss industrial group as the board and major shareholders look for a speedier turnaround. A slew of positive news including upbeat earnings from semiconductor equipment maker ASML Holding, the China data and a Qualcomm-Apple settlement drove chipmakers in the region higher.

Shares of Qualcomm, which closed up 23 percent on Tuesday, rose another 10 percent in premarket trade on Wednesday after it signed a six-year patent license deal with Apple. If Wednesdays gains hold, Qualcomm would tack on more than $20 billion in market value since announcing the settlement. The two companies had been at odds over patents and royalties over modems. While Qualcomm did not close the terms of the deal, analysts estimated that Apple withheld $5 billion, or about $2 per share, under its previous royalty payment agreement. Qualcomm and Huawei are also fighting over the same issues. Huawei stopped royalty payments in April 2017 and Qualcomm said in January it has signed an interim agreement with the Chinese company and is in talks for a final resolution. We now expect an imminent settlement with Huawei which has also been withholding royalty payments, which we estimate will add another $0.50-$0.75 of EPS, Cowen and Company analysts said. Three brokerages raised their ratings on Qualcomms stock and at least eight brokerages boosted their price targets. Fourteen out of 25 brokerages rated the stock buy or higher and the rest hold, according to Refinitiv data. A settlement with Apple and Huawei will not only bring in more royalty payments and reduce legal costs, it will help Qualcomm to focus more in rolling out its 5G modems, several analysts said. The Qualcomm settlement means Apple will rely on the chipmaker for most if not all of its 5G modems in iPhones starting in 2020, with Qualcomm likely the leading to only supplier for the next several years, Canaccord Genuity analysts said.\\n'],\n",

       "  '(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc added $30 billion to its market value after it resolved a legal battle with Apple Inc, a move that secures its leadership in 5G phone chips and could pave the way for a similar settlement with Chinas Huawei Technologies. The companys shares, which closed up 23 percent on Tuesday after the announcement, rose as much as 17 percent on Wednesday, hitting their highest in nearly two decades. The deal with Apple, coming at the cusp of the rollout of high-speed 5G network, could help Qualcomm return to the preeminent position it held in the early 2010s when it dominated the transition to 4G mobile networks and expanded revenues dramatically. Qualcomms fortunes are also looking up since Intel Corp, which had been Apples sole iPhone chip supplier for the past year, decided to exit the modem chip business following Qualcomms settlement with Apple. In the US, around 5G its Qualcomms world and everyone else is just paying rent, said Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. This was a game changing settlement for Qualcomm and was also a smart move by Apple to clear this noise and focus on 5G smartphones for 2020. Wall Street analysts scrambled to raise their recommendations and price targets on Qualcomms stock following the settlement. At least three brokerages raised their ratings and nine ratcheted up their price targets. Stifel made the most aggressive move by raising its target by $43 to $100 - well above the median price target of $75.85. Of the 25 brokerages covering the stock, 14 rate it buy or higher and the rest have a hold rating, according to Refinitiv data. Bond investors also joined in, with Qualcomms 4.3 percent 2047 issuance becoming one of the most heavily traded bonds in the U.S. corporate space on Wednesday, according to capital markets publication IFR. The company could make $2 billion annually by taking Intels market share and regain the dominant position it enjoyed during the rollout of 4G, analysts said. The settlement also helps Apple close the gap with rivals such as South Koreas Samsung Electronics Co and Huawei in delivering a 5G phone.

       "  '(Reuters) - Apple Inc was accused in a new lawsuit of securities fraud for concealing a slump in demand for iPhones, particularly in China, leading to a $74 billion one-day slide in its market value once the truth became known.    The complaint filed on Tuesday seeks damages for investors who bought Apple stock in the two months before Chief Executive Tim Cook on Jan. 2 unexpectedly reduced Apples quarterly revenue forecast as much as $9 billion, in part because of the intensifying U.S. trade war with China.     It was the first time since the iPhones 2007 launch that Apple had cut its revenue forecast. Apples share price fell 10 percent the next day, leaving the Cupertino, California-based companys market value roughly 40 percent below its $1.1 trillion peak three months earlier. Cook and Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri were also named as defendants in the proposed class action. Apple did not immediately respond on Wednesday to requests for comment. The lawsuit was filed in the federal court in Oakland, California by the City of Roseville Employees Retirement System, a Michigan pension plan. It is represented by Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd, a securities class-action specialist. The complaint said iPhone demand was falling because of U.S.-China trade tensions and customers growing preference to replace batteries in older iPhones, prompting Apple to slash orders from suppliers for new iPhones and cut prices to reduce inventory. But none of this was disclosed when it should have been, the complaint said, in part because of Apples Nov. 1, 2018 decision to stop disclosing unit sales for iPhones. Asked during a conference call that day about Apples performance in emerging markets, Cook cited downward pressures on sales in Brazil and India, but said I would not put China in that category, the complaint said. The lawsuit was filed on the same day Apple settled all its litigation with Qualcomm Inc. Their disputes centered mainly on Qualcomm patents for mobile chips, and how much Apple should pay to use the technology.

Democratic Governor Tony Evers, who took office in January, inherited a deal to give Foxconn around $4 billion in tax breaks and other incentives that was championed by Scott Walker, the states former Republican governor. Announced at a White House ceremony in 2017, Foxconns 20-million square foot campus marked the largest greenfield investment by a foreign-based company in U.S. history and was praised by President Donald Trump as proof of his ability to revive American manufacturing. Foxconn, a major supplier to Apple Inc., has pledged to eventually create 13,000 jobs in Wisconsin, but said earlier this year it had slowed its pace of hiring. The present contract deals with a situation that no longer exists so its our goal to make sure that the taxpayers are protected and environmental standards are protected and we believe that we need to take a look at that contract, Evers told reporters. Foxconn representatives did not immediately comment. The company has wavered on its goals for the $10 billion project this year. Louis Woo, special assistant to Foxconn Chief Executive Terry Gou, told Reuters in January Foxconn was reconsidering plans to make advanced liquid crystal display panels. He said Foxconn would hire mostly engineers and researchers rather than the manufacturing workforce originally promised in Wisconsin. Days later, the company said it would build the factory after Gou spoke to Trump. Gou earlier on Wednesday announced he was running for president of Taiwan. He had told Reuters on Monday he planned to step down from Foxconn, the worlds largest contract manufacturer, to pave the way for younger talent to move up the companys ranks.\\n'],\n",
